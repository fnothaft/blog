Ontario Peak.

## Comments

This hike starts in a very beautiful area, with both canyon and mountain views.

We took the [HPS #1](http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/15frt1.htm) route up.
This route follows a firebreak up the mountain and is very easy to find. At Cow
Canyon Saddle, there is a gated fire road that runs alongside the mountain. This
is the start to the [HPS #2](http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/15frt2.htm)
route. The firebreak is about 100 feet to the east along Glendora Ridge Road, and
starts by following an electrical line.

The firebreak climbs steeply, but is reasonably easy. There is some class 2 hiking
going up this route, and it’d be a reasonably good idea to bring hiking poles (this,
we did not do). At one point, the firebreak intersects with a forest service road.
This forest service road is part of the [HPS #2](http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/15frt2.htm)
route, and adds about one half mile to your climb. These two routes meet again at
the top of the mountain.

The view from the top is a spectacular 360° view of both the Baldy Bowl and the valley
leading into Mount Baldy Village. Directly to your north is Lookout Mountain, which
is dwarfed by Mount Baldy. The Three T’s sit to your east, along with Ontario and
Sugarloaf Peaks.

We followed the firebreak back down to it’s intersection with the forest service road.
Instead of crawling back down the firebreak, we opted for the much less steep route
down the forest road. The forest road is a pleasant and easy hike but definitely
does not have the views of the firebreak.

Since Sunset Peak is <6000 feet, it can be climbed year round as it’ll stay below the
snow line. Note that the route up via the firebreak is completely exposed, so it should
be avoided on hot and sunny days. The forest service road does have pleasant and ample shade.
